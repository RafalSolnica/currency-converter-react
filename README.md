# Rafał Solnica - Currency converter

![Money](./src/images/README_background.png)

Welcome to my simple currency converter that I've made as a homework during YouCode front-end course.

## For the first time I used in this project:

- JavaScript functions
- simple form validation
- icon designed by me with the help of Canva website: https://www.canva.com/

## Demo

## https://rafalsolnica.github.io/currency-converter/

## How does it work?

In the first field choose starting currency, in second enter the amount, and then in the third select currency you want to convert into. Next click "Przelicz" button and result should show under the form.

In case of not stating any amount of currency the field will highlight itself signaling error. The error will go away once correct value gets be entered or the form gets cleared with the "Wyczyść" button.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
